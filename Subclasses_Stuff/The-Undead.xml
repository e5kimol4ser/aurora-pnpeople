			<p>The Undead is an entity that resides in the dark corners of the multiverse. Your patron could be Acererak, Azalin, Lord Soth, Strahd, or some other ancient undead being. You may seek to gain knowledge from your patron’s countless lifetimes of experience, while it may see you as a piece of a centuries long plan.</p>

			<p><em>1st-level Undead feature</em></p>
			<p>You manifest an aspect of your patron’s dreadful power. As a bonus action, you transform for 1 minute. You gain the following benefits while transformed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d10 + your warlock level.</li>
				<li>Once during each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw, and if the saving throw fails, the target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>
				<li>You are immune to the frightened condition.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can transform a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">The appearance of your Form of Dread reflects some aspect of your patron. For example, your form could be a shroud of shadows forming the crown and robes of your lich patron, or your face might transform into bat-like features due to your vampire patron.</p>

			<p>Your patron’s powers have a profound effect on your body and magic. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you hit a creature with an attack and roll damage against the creature, you can replace the damage type with necrotic damage.

			<p><em>14th-level Undead feature</em></p>
			<p>Your body is now simply a vessel for your spirit. As an action, you can project your spirit from your body. The body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your spirit can remain outside your body for up to 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). When your projection ends, your spirit returns to your body or your body magically teleports to your spirit’s space (your choice).</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Your spirit and body gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.</li>
				<li>When you cast a spell of the conjuration or necromancy school, the spell doesn’t require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.</li>
				<li>You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature or an object.</li>
				<li>While you are using your Form of Dread, once during each of your turns when you deal necrotic damage to a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.</li>
